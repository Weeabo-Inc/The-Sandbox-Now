# Buildaverse died.
Buildaverse has officially died. Many of the once extremely loyal staff members are already leaving the team after learning that Buildaverse might just not be as good as they originally thought.

### Controversy
Buildaverse has been surrounded by controversy after controversy the last few months. From lack of communication to not paying the developers for their work. Or banning anyobody for the mere act of criticisng anything in regards to the development of Buildaverse.

### Cubash - Shattering the Buildaverse narrative
The development and transparency of Cubash proved wrong almost every argument Buildaverse in regards to **criticism**, **transparency** or **team size** aswell as **professionalism**. While Buildaverse was busy creating mousepads for "Hype", Cubash was busy writing the next transparency report, that had as much as twice the ammount of hype. 

> Fun Fact! Cubash was made and released in a quarter of the ammount of time Buildaverse took to do a website, that got reverted to 0%.

### Isaac Hymmer
Isaac (Owner of BrickPlanet) has mentioned previously his dislike torwards Buildaverse, and mentioned that they were not to be trusted.

### Developers
If this was not enough, ALL OF THE WEB DEVELOPMENT TEAM (And I repeat, ALL OF THEM) quit their jobs at Buildaverse after learning that they were consiered "volunteer workers" and that they would have no confirmed payments for their work.

As a side note, Jordan (owner of Buildaverse) said he couldnt afford paying the devs. And just a few weeks later he sent a beautiful photo of his new Tesla on the general chat.

Even if its used, It can be assured it cost him at least 40.000 USD.

### Money hungry
Before the final note, we wanted to mention that leadership treats users as wallets, they had biased treatment torwards the members with most likely to donate substantial ammounts of money. While from a marketing standpoint it would make sense, they did not do any type of math, calculation, prevision or even a meeting to discuss possible investments with these users, rather just treated them better than the rest of the users and kept a low profile to make it seem as if there was nothing behind the courtains.

### Final note.
At the BTT we believe we've made clear our standpoint on this topic, and hope people see the truth.

Best regards, and credits to all the ex-buildaverse staff who contributed to this post.
